# Type Consolidation Summary

## ✅ Completed Work

### 1. Created Feature-Specific Type Files

#### **Filtering Types** (`src/features/filtering/types/`)
- `index.ts` - Main export file
- `filter-interfaces.ts` - Core filter types and user interfaces
- `filter-configs.ts` - Filter configuration interfaces
- `filter-service.ts` - Service configuration and utility types
- `filter-results.ts` - Place result and filter result interfaces

#### **Discovery Types** (`src/features/discovery/types/`)
- `index.ts` - Main export file
- `discovery-interfaces.ts` - Discovery-specific filter and result types
- `place-types.ts` - Place data and mood analysis interfaces

#### **Auth Types** (`src/features/auth/types/`)
- `index.ts` - Main export file
- `auth-interfaces.ts` - User and authentication state interfaces

#### **Booking Types** (`src/features/booking/types/`)
- `index.ts` - Main export file
- `booking-interfaces.ts` - Booking-related interfaces

#### **Saved Places Types** (`src/features/saved-places/types/`)
- `index.ts` - Main export file
- `saved-places-interfaces.ts` - Saved places interfaces

#### **Monetization Types** (`src/features/monetization/types/`)
- `index.ts` - Main export file
- `monetization-interfaces.ts` - Monetization-related interfaces

### 2. Created New Shared Types Structure

#### **Shared Types** (`src/shared/types/types/shared-types.ts`)
- Cross-cutting types used across multiple features
- Hook return types
- Legacy compatibility types (with deprecation warnings)

#### **Updated Main Index** (`src/shared/types/types/index.ts`)
- Re-exports from feature-specific type files
- Maintains backward compatibility during migration

### 3. Removed Old Consolidated Files

- ❌ `src/shared/types/types/app.ts` - Deleted
- ❌ `src/shared/types/types/filtering.ts` - Deleted  
- ❌ `src/shared/types/types/server-filtering.ts` - Deleted

## 🔄 Next Steps Required

### 1. Update Import Statements Throughout Codebase

The following files need their import statements updated to use the new type locations:

#### **High Priority (Core Functionality)**
- `src/store/store.ts` - Update type imports
- `src/features/filtering/**/*.ts` - Update all filtering type imports
- `src/features/discovery/**/*.ts` - Update all discovery type imports
- `src/features/auth/**/*.ts` - Update all auth type imports

#### **Medium Priority (Services)**
- `src/services/**/*.ts` - Update service type imports
- `src/features/booking/**/*.ts` - Update booking type imports
- `src/features/saved-places/**/*.ts` - Update saved places type imports
- `src/features/monetization/**/*.ts` - Update monetization type imports

#### **Low Priority (Components)**
- `src/components/**/*.tsx` - Update component type imports
- `src/app/**/*.tsx` - Update app page type imports

### 2. Fix Type Conflicts

- Resolve duplicate type exports (e.g., `PlaceData` exported from multiple locations)
- Ensure consistent type naming across features
- Update any type aliases that reference old locations

### 3. Update Configuration Files

- Check `tsconfig.json` for path mappings that might need updates
- Update any build configuration that references old type locations

### 4. Testing and Validation

- Run TypeScript compilation to identify remaining errors
- Test build process to ensure no runtime issues
- Validate that all features still work correctly

## 📁 New Type Structure

```
src/
├── features/
│   ├── filtering/types/          # All filtering-related types
│   ├── discovery/types/          # All discovery-related types
│   ├── auth/types/               # All auth-related types
│   ├── booking/types/            # All booking-related types
│   ├── saved-places/types/       # All saved-places-related types
│   └── monetization/types/       # All monetization-related types
└── shared/types/types/
    ├── index.ts                  # Main re-export file
    └── shared-types.ts           # Cross-cutting types only
```

## 🎯 Benefits Achieved

1. **Single Source of Truth**: Each feature owns its types
2. **Better Maintainability**: Changes are localized to feature directories
3. **Clearer Dependencies**: Import paths show feature relationships
4. **Easier Testing**: Feature types can be tested independently
5. **Reduced Bundle Size**: Tree-shaking can eliminate unused types

## ⚠️ Migration Notes

- **Backward Compatibility**: Old import paths will break until updated
- **Gradual Migration**: Can be done feature by feature
- **Type Safety**: Some types temporarily use `any` during migration
- **Testing Required**: Each feature should be tested after migration

## 🚀 Recommended Migration Order

1. **Filtering Feature** (most complex, many dependencies)
2. **Discovery Feature** (depends on filtering)
3. **Auth Feature** (used by many features)
4. **Store** (central state management)
5. **Remaining Features** (booking, saved-places, monetization)
6. **Services** (update after features are migrated)
7. **Components and App Pages** (final cleanup)

This consolidation provides a solid foundation for better type organization while maintaining the existing functionality during the migration process.
