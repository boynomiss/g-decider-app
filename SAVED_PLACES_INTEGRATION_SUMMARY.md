## ðŸ”„ Data Flow

### Save Process
1. User taps save button on place card
2. `handleSavePlace` function called
3. `isSaved` check determines if place is already saved
4. `savePlace` or `removePlace` called accordingly
5. UI updates with visual feedback
6. Data persisted to AsyncStorage

### Load Process
1. App starts up
2. `useSavedPlaces` hook loads saved places from AsyncStorage
3. Places converted to consistent format
4. State updated with saved places
5. UI reflects saved state across app

## ðŸ’¾ Storage Implementation

### AsyncStorage Keys
- **Key**: `@saved_places`
- **Format**: JSON array of place objects
- **Persistence**: Survives app restarts

### Data Conversion
- **Input**: `PlaceData` or `Suggestion` objects
- **Output**: Consistent `Suggestion` format
- **Handles**: Different data structures from various sources
